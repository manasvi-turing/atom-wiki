# Atom Wiki

**The simplest way to share your knowledge.**

## What Is This?

A powerful tool that converts a folder of markdown files into a **single, beautiful HTML page** with:
- 🎨 Modern, responsive design
- 📂 Hierarchical navigation
- 🔍 Interactive table of contents
- 🏷️ Tag-based organization
- 🌓 Dark/Light themes
- 📱 Mobile-friendly

## Why Use This?

Stop fighting with complex documentation tools. **Just write markdown** and get:

✅ **One file to share** - No deployment needed  
✅ **Works offline** - Share via email, USB, or cloud (needs internet first load for fonts)  
✅ **GitHub Pages ready** - Instant documentation site  
✅ **Minimal dependencies** - Just fonts/icons from CDN (cached after first load)  
✅ **Beautiful by default** - Professional appearance  

## Quick Example

```bash
# Write your markdown files
docs/
  ├── index.md
  ├── guide.md
  └── api.md

# Generate wiki
atom-wiki docs -o my-wiki.html

# Share anywhere!
# ✓ Email it
# ✓ Upload to cloud
# ✓ GitHub Pages
# ✓ Company intranet
```
