## Test Features

With DataTables enabled, you should be able to:

1. **Search** - Type in the search box to filter rows
2. **Sort** - Click column headers to sort ascending/descending
3. **Paginate** - Navigate through pages if table has many rows
4. **Page size** - Choose how many rows to display (5, 10, 25, 50, 100)

## Simple 2-Row Table (Should NOT get DataTables)

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Search | âœ… Enabled |

This tiny table should remain simple.
