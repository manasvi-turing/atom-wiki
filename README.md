## My Tool Hopping Saga

I went through more note-taking tools than a digital nomad goes through coffee shops, and here's the realization that hit me: each tool was brilliant at what it did, but maybe a bit too brilliant for my needs.

Notion is fantastic for team wikis and databases, but I found myself spending more time designing pretty pages than actually writing content. Obsidian's graph view is pure magic for visual thinkers, but I kept getting lost connecting notes that didn't exist yet. MS Word remains the undisputed champion for formal documents, but I was constantly fighting formatting demons instead of capturing thoughts.

Confluence? Absolute powerhouse for enterprise teams - just felt like using a battleship to cross a pond for my personal notes. Hugo and Jekyll are incredible for serious web publishing, but configuration paralysis set in fast when I just wanted to write. Google Docs makes collaboration seamless, though sharing felt like hosting a party where everyone needs ID checks. And Gitbook creates stunning documentation - it's just that another subscription started quietly eating my wallet.

All amazing tools, just... not quite right for someone who mainly wants to think, write, and own their words.

## The Great Trade-Off

**What I happily abandoned:**
- ‚ùå Central server drama
- ‚ùå Auto-sync anxiety  
- ‚ùå Real-time collaboration FOMO

**What I gained:**
- ‚úÖ Actual writing time
- ‚úÖ True ownership (my files, my rules)
- ‚úÖ Zero subscription guilt
- ‚úÖ The joy of "it just works"

## The Magic Spell

```bash
uvx --from "git+https://github.com/manasvi-turing/atom-wiki.git" atom-wiki ./docs -o wiki.html
```

One command. One beautiful HTML file. Infinite possibilities.

## What You Get

‚úÖ One self-contained HTML file (no "where are my images?")  
‚úÖ Navigation that doesn't require a map  
‚úÖ Themes that don't hurt your eyes  
‚úÖ Works on your grandma's computer from 2008  
‚úÖ No database to appease, no server to feed  
‚úÖ Files you'll actually own in 2045
