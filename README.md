# üìö Atom Wiki

> **Turn your markdown folder into one HTML file. Share it on a USB stick. Email it. Put it on a server. It's just a file.**

## My Journey (The Short Version)

I kept trying different tools:
- **Notion** - Loved it, but spent more time organizing pages than writing
- **Obsidian** - Beautiful graphs, but I got lost connecting notes instead of creating them
- **MS Word** - Familiar, but I didn't want to waste time on fonts and spacing
- **Confluence** - Great for teams, but $10/user/month felt steep for my notes
- **Hugo/Jekyll** - Powerful, but I just wanted to write, not configure Ruby/Node
- **Google Docs** - Simple, but sharing meant endless permission requests
- **ReadTheDocs** - Professional, but seemed overkill for personal docs
- **Gitbook** - Beautiful, but another subscription I didn't need

I realized: I wasn't building knowledge. I was building *furniture for knowledge that never moved in.*

**What I gave up (and why I'm okay with it):**
- ‚ùå Central server? Don't need it. My knowledge lives in files I can backup however I want.
- ‚ùå Auto-sync between devices? I'll manage. Git, Dropbox, or a USB stick work fine.
- ‚ùå Real-time collaboration? Rarely needed. I focus on thinking deeply, then share when ready.

**What I gained:**
- ‚úÖ FOSS philosophy - Open source, inspect the code, modify it, own it completely.
- ‚úÖ No vendor lock-in - My files are mine. Forever. No export, no migration needed.
- ‚úÖ Simple workflow - Write markdown anywhere (even WhatsApp), polish later, build when ready.

The ideas matter more than the sync. The ownership matters more than the convenience.

So I built this:

```bash
atom-wiki ./my-docs -o wiki.html
```

**One command. One HTML file. Done.**

Now I write in Markdown (in VimWiki, like a civilized person), run one command, and get a beautiful wiki I can:
- Drop on a USB stick
- Email to anyone
- Put on any server
- Open in 2045 and it still works

No subscriptions. No "please upgrade" popups. No vendor lock-in. Just files.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
uvx --from "git+https://github.com/manasvi-turing/atom-wiki.git" atom-wiki

# Run
atom-wiki ./your-docs -o wiki.html

# Share (literally any way you want)
cp wiki.html /Volumes/USB/
```

## What You Get

‚úÖ **One self-contained HTML file** with all your docs  
‚úÖ **Beautiful navigation** (hierarchical sidebar + floating TOC)  
‚úÖ **Dark/light/system themes** that actually look good  
‚úÖ **Works everywhere** (desktop, tablet, phone)  
‚úÖ **No database** to migrate, no server to maintain  
‚úÖ **Yours forever** - just a file you own

**Current caveat:** Uses CDNs for fonts/icons/syntax highlighting (cached after first load). Optional DataTables for interactive tables. Working on fully embedded mode soon!
